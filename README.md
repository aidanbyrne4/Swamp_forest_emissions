Requirements:
1) Google drive
2) Google Earth Engine (GEE) account
3) 2 X GEE Image Collection Assets

This code obtains remote sensing data from GEE through the Python API. Requires two additional datasets:
1) Groundtruth data for classifying swamp forests
2) Greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes by water table level

Download these two datasets and save them to your google drive. You can then run the code.  

NOTE: Classification accuracy and the subsequent analyses are subject to minor variations due to upstream source data and code functionality updates on the Google Earth Engine servers.
